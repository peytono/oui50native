        contents: "I have been divorced for two years, and have gone through much transformation as a result of my marriage ending.  For many years, I thought keeping the peace was the best way to navigate through troubling times.  I thought I could preserve the family unit by doing keeping the peace, but somethings are out of our control. Break If you are the peace keeper, it’s a very hard habit to break.  We think that we’re actually doing our best by keeping the peace, but most of the time we’re just walking on eggshells allowing negative behaviors to occur, doing our best not to react. /*p break */ But… does repressing emotions really make us better people?  I have concluded that it does not. /*p break */ If you are living in a negative environment, no matter how much tiptoeing you do, you can not change that energy.  You can chose not to engage, but that person and that energy are still there./*p break */ I began dating someone several months after my ex and I parted ways.  I wasn’t looking to date anyone, but he showed interest and the attention made me feel good.  There were several red flags that this wasn’t a good idea, but I convinced myself that it was my nerves overreacting, and it very well may have been, but in retrospect it was my intuition. /*p break */ I really wasn’t being treated the way that I wanted to, but resided in the fact that everyone who has reached this age was going to have a hard time finding true love. /*p break */ Don’t get me wrong, It wasn’t all bad.  There were many good times that we shared, but my smile began to fade. /*p break */ I searched and googled as much self help that I could find.  Everything I found indicated he wasn’t the one, but I kept at it for 11 months. /*p break */ One of my favorite relationship authors is Jeff Brown.  He said that we often times will look for the person to work out the same unresolved issues that we had in our failed relationships.  I started seeing the truth there.  I was trying to keep the peace, again! /*p break */         I couldn’t understand why my husband didn’t love me.  I couldn’t understand why this guy didn’t love me either.  I allowed negative behaviors from him because that was what I was used to. /*p break */        I had become a master at not taking offense to moodiness or lack of attention or affection.  I could overlook all of that because I knew there was a connection between the two of us. /*p break */        After a couple of short breaks I finally did articulate to him what I needed.  I wanted to do this right.  Communicate without fear.  So I did.  He agreed to giving what I asked for.  When the opportunity arose for him to step up to that agreement, he withdrew and so did I.  It wasn’t that I was being too sensitive.  I wasn’t asking for a lot, in fact too little.  It was disrupting my peace of mind. It’s not that I didn’t care about him, it’s that I care for myself more. /*p break */        One night, I was listening to this young man, Trent Shelton who has since become motivational coach. He said, protect your peace.  It made so much sense.  All of a sudden, it dawned on me… and keeping the peace was replaced by protecting it. /*p break */        Don’t allow yourself to be subjected to anyone who doesn’t bring out the best in you.  Keep your circle small and only surround yourself with people who truly love you.  Stop making excuses for other people.  If they bring you down more than up, let them go. /*p break */        Keep your peace. /*p break */        That’s what I’m doing now.  I really do have some of the most amazing friends in my circle.  Several small circles of people who love me, support me, bring out the best in me, encourage me, and inspire me.  If this one guy can’t be a part of that, then it’s not the right fit. /*p break */        To get through the lonely times of being single, I put less value on romantic love and more value on the love of my friends and family. /*p break */        Protect your peace the way you would your flower garden, and watch how beautiful it will grow."

I was on vacation in Montezuma, Costa Rica. We went zip lining, and once we got up high enough, we were led to this waterfall. It was one of those, once in a lifetime moments. Aside from a little anxiety, I was ready for my first jump at the young age of 52. Strong legs and a solid core got me soaring off of that cliff. Keep at your routine. No matter what your fitness goals are because you never know what challenge you may face."

        contents: "“If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.” ― Albert Einstein. I am a junkie for a good inspirational quote.  This quote has been my mantra for the past few weeks. How many days have I pined away over the way someone is treating me.  Even while it’s happening I know what I’m really doing is procrastinating my list of things to do. It is so true, that the mind thinks it’s being productive while problem solving.  But how to quit all that mumbo jumbo that repeatedly cycles and loops through the mind? Grieving is natural and acceptable.  We grieve over things not going our way often, for loss of people who have passed or who chose to leave us. We grieve over the machines we rely on when we they break down and every time we turn on the news. The choice we need to make is how long should we suffer?  Make a decision to grieve or not, but know that you are giving this decision a lot of power and energy that could go towards something great, like writing your novel, going for a long walk, cooking a fantastic meal for your favorite people, or painting your living room a new color. It’s hard to stop the grieving and worrying so ween yourself a little each day. Today I’ll allow myself to think about this problem for 30 minutes, tomorrow 25 minutes and each day shave five minutes off until you’re done .And if you still miss that worrying, only do it five minutes a day.Go outside and weed the yard, plant a flower, and most importantly find something to smile about."

    contents: "The CEO of the second-largest airline in the world says passengers should ask permission when they recline their seat.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview with CNBC he believes that passengers on planes should make sure it's alright with the passenger behind you before reclining.The proper thing to do if you recline into somebody is that you ask if it's OK first and then you do it,' Bastian said in an interview on Squawk Box.The question came in response to a now- viral video of an American Airlines passenger berating the person in front of him for reclining her seat.The angry passenger went as far as to punch the back of her seat repeatedly in protest of the recline, sparking debate as to whether passengers should recline their seats if there is someone behind them.Reclining a seat greatly reduces the amount of available space for the person behind and may prevent them from doing tasks such as working on a laptop.The action often has a ripple effect subsequently leading further passengers down the line to recline their seats to salvage any remaining open space, which ultimately has an adverse effect on those in seats which cannot or have limited recline."

A capsule wardrobe will allow you to pack efficiently and lightly. You won’t need to worry about whether you’re taking too little or too much. Some capsule wardrobes will even fit into a carry-on, taking away the hassle of having to check-in luggage!Top tips for creating a capsule wardrobe for Europe: Choose basic separates in neutral colours.Pack things that you will wear more than once in a number of ways.For example, a tank top could be worn during the day but also in the evening with a nice pair of shoes and an accessory.Nail the basic wardrobe and then add a few other seasonal items.For example, shorts or sundresses for the summer, a scarf for layering during autumn or sprucing up an outfit in the evening.Clothing: Europe enjoys spring, summer, autumn and winter! While the the summers can be baking hot, the winters can get rather cold and chilly, but autumn and spring are mild and pleasant.If you’re travelling in winter, you’ll need to take a warm coat and likewise, if you’re visiting in the the summer, leave your fleece lined boots behind.Compression bags make packing for longer trips easier.Order our favourites here."
